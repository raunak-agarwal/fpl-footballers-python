# fpl-player-data-python

This script retrieves the fpl data for all the possible players playing in the premier league. 

Running fpldata.py creates a json dump of all player data in a file called 'data.txt'. It might take some time to execute as there are 500+ players and each players' data needs to be individually retrieved.
